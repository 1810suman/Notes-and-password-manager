# Notes-and-password-manager
My first project

This code is for an "Advanced Note & Password Manager" web application. The HTML structure defines two sections: one for managing notes and another for managing passwords. JavaScript functions handle adding, deleting, and displaying notes/passwords. Local storage is used to store the notes and passwords data persistently. Styling is done with CSS to create a clean and responsive layout. Users can add notes with a text area and passwords with website, username, and password fields. The design features a centered layout with sections for notes and passwords side by side, styled with a soothing color scheme and buttons for interactions.
